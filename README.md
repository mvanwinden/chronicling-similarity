# Chronicling similarity
This Python script computes the Jaccard similarity of year descriptions within XML-parsed chronicles of Rotterdam. This serves as a demonstration of the potential applications of this method in quantifying the extent of text reuse in the chronicles of Rotterdam.

The file 'parsed_rotterdam_chronicles.ndjson' can be used to run the script. 

## Work in Progress
The current script utilizes the Pandas library to create data frames that encompass the chronicle's content. To further enhance its functionality, future updates will adopt a more streamlined approach by eliminating the generation of unnecessary data.
