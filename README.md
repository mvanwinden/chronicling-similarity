# Chronicling similarity
This Python script computes the Jaccard similarity of year descriptions within XML-parsed chronicles. For demonstration purposes, this repository contains a corpus of five seventeenth-century Rotterdam chronicles. 

## Usage
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory where the repository is located.
3. Ensure that you have the required Python libraries installed. These are **pandas**, **numpy**, **seaborn**, and **matplotlib**.
4. Ensure the reference file **parsed_rotterdam_chronicles.ndjson** is located in the same directory as **chronicling_similarity.py**.
5. Run the script.

Plots of the event distribution and the jaccard similarities will be saved to the directory as a vector image.

## Acknowledgements
The corpus of Rotterdam chronicles was created using an XML-parser developed by the Aarhus University Centre for Humanities Computing, which is available at https://github.com/centre-for-humanities-computing/dutch-chronicles.
